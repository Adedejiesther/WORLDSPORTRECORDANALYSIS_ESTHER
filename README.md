Observations:
1. Medals and Athletes: The dataset records 27,000 medal-related entries, with a total of 54,000 medals.
2. Key Metrics: It tracks athletes' age, height, and weight, totaling 5 million years, 71.04 million meters, and 14.3 million metric tons respectively.
3. Tax Analysis:
• By Season: The majority of the "Tax" metric originates from the Summer
Games.
•By Sex: Male participants contribute 72.11% of the tax, while females contribute 27.89%.
• By Team and Host Country: Significant variations are observed, with countries like the United Kingdom leading host contributions.
• By Sport: Weightlifting and Wrestling generate higher "tax" values than other sport

RECOMMENDATION
1 .l recommend conducting a detailed analysis of male and female contributions to address any disparities and enhance gender parity in sports.
2. I recommend prioritizing the Summer Games for strategic investments, as they contribute significantly to the metrics.
3. I recommend focusing on high-performing host countries and cities, such as the United Kingdom and Sydney, to replicate their success factors in future event
4. I recommend investing in sports like Weightlifting and Wrestling, which generate high "Tax" contributions, to increase funding and engagement opportunities.
